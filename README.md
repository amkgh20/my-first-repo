This is just a small text file associated with an online "Unix Workbench Course".
There is nothing much to see here.
I would rather have people be interested in doing better for the planet, other species and themselves, instead of peeking into, poring over, and "gnattily" querying on, mundane trivia about me.
If at all looking, look contextually. Never ever engage in ignorant observation, purposeless parroting and delinquent insistence.
